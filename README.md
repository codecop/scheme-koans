scheme-koans
======================

This is a repository about koans in scheme.

Reading koans is a great method to see the truth of one given language.

The mind behind it is the TDD(Test Drived Develop), Top-down design.

By the way, the scheme language is a dialect of lisp designed for conciseness.

It is a graceful language in the noisy world.

However, there are few learning materials.

I hope this repository will be helpful to the beginnners.
